First, download the entire files available in the above google drive link into a single folder just like the ones available in the above link. Next run the EXE file as the administrator. And then start following the below steps.

•	This project is designed to work in the command prompt in the background once it is launched. 
•	As soon as it is launched, it will ask the user for his/her name, (for which the input is in the form of a voice command) and it will introduce itself.
•	Once it introduces itself, it will ask for the language that the user wants to talk in with the assistant (Here the input is to be typed using the keyboard.)
•	Now to invoke the assistant, you must call it by its name, “Nani”.
•	Start talking to the assistant in the language you wished to talk to the assistant in.
